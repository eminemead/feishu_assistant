We're migrating to Mastra framework to:\n\n1. **Simplify agent architecture** - Native model fallback arrays eliminate dual-agent pattern\n2. **Improve observability** - Mastra AI Tracing designed specifically for LLM operations (vs custom devtools)\n3. **Modernize tech stack** - Mastra is actively developed with 18.5k GitHub stars, strong community\n4. **Reduce code complexity** - Remove ~500 lines of handoff routing + dual agent management\n5. **Unify memory system** - Mastra memory + PostgreSQL replaces ai-sdk-tools + Supabase+Drizzle\n\n## Long-Term Goals This Serves\n\n1. **Production readiness** - Move to actively maintained framework with better observability\n2. **Scalability** - PostgreSQL memory backend scales better than Drizzle+Supabase for concurrent users\n3. **Team knowledge** - Mastra becoming de facto standard in AI agent community (LLM layer unification)\n4. **Developer velocity** - Simpler codebase = faster feature development + fewer bugs\n5. **Cost optimization** - Consolidated observability (Langfuse) vs custom devtools + Feishu logging\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### Current State (ai-sdk-tools)\n- Dual agents (primary + fallback) for model fallback\n- Custom devtools tracking (~300 lines of tracking code)\n- ai-sdk-tools memory with Supabase backend\n- Manual agent handoff routing with regex patterns\n- Cache layer with TTL support\n\n### Target State (Mastra)\n- Single agent with model array fallback (auto-managed by Mastra)\n- Native AI Tracing with multiple exporter options (Langfuse, Braintrust, OTEL)\n- Mastra memory with PostgreSQL backend\n- Native Mastra workflow/agent switching (no custom routing needed)\n- Mastra built-in caching\n\n### Compatibility Notes\n- Tools already use universal tool() signature from 'ai' package - no changes needed\n- Memory migration is bidirectional (can coexist initially)\n- Observability improvements are backwards compatible\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\n### Phase 1: Setup \u0026 Infrastructure (Days 1-2)\n- Add Mastra observability config (PinoLogger, AI Tracing)\n- Verify PostgreSQL schema for Mastra memory\n- Test connection pooling and transaction handling\n\n### Phase 2: Agent Migration (Days 3-5)\n- Migrate Manager Agent (highest impact, orchestrator)\n- Migrate specialist agents (OKR, Alignment, P\u0026L, DPA-PM)\n- No changes needed for tools (already compatible)\n\n### Phase 3: Memory \u0026 State (Day 6)\n- Transition conversation history to Mastra memory\n- Verify RLS still works correctly\n- Run dual-read tests (both memory systems)\n\n### Phase 4: Observability (Day 7)\n- Configure Langfuse exporter\n- Set up real-time tracing (dev) + batch mode (prod)\n- Retire custom devtools-integration.ts\n\n### Phase 5: Testing \u0026 Validation (Days 8-10)\n- Unit tests for all migrated agents\n- Integration tests (multi-turn, memory persistence)\n- E2E tests (full Feishu workflow)\n- Performance regression testing\n\n### Phase 6: Cleanup (Day 11)\n- Remove ai-sdk-tools dependencies (if not used elsewhere)\n- Deprecate custom implementations\n- Update documentation and team knowledge base\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n1. ✅ All 5 agents working with Mastra (unit test passing)\n2. ✅ Memory fully transitioned (integration tests passing)\n3. ✅ Observability provides equal or better insights\n4. ✅ No regression in response times (performance tests)\n5. ✅ All tests passing in CI/CD\n6. ✅ Code review approved\n7. ✅ Deployed to production with monitoring\n8. ✅ ai-sdk-tools removed (if applicable)\n\n## Risk Mitigation\n\n1. **Keep both frameworks during transition** - Run tests against both implementations\n2. **Gradual rollout** - Migrate agents one by one, not all at once\n3. **Memory coexistence** - Support both memory backends during transition period\n4. **Rollback ready** - Keep ai-sdk-tools in package.json until fully validated in production\n5. **Monitoring** - Enhanced observability helps catch issues faster\n\n## External References\n\n- [Mastra Documentation](https://mastra.ai/docs)\n- [Mastra AI Tracing](https://mastra.ai/docs/observability/ai-tracing/overview)\n- [Langfuse Integration](https://mastra.ai/docs/observability/ai-tracing/exporters/langfuse)\n- [Mastra Memory System](https://mastra.ai/docs/memory)\n- [Current Implementation Plan](./MASTRA_MIGRATION_PLAN.md)","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-02T12:48:49.721838+08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-02T12:49:08.849454+08:00","source_repo":"."}

Historical OKR metrics tables (okr_metrics_*)\n   - Company performance data\n   - Employee/fellow data\n   - Query results and analysis summaries\n\n2. **Conversation History**\n   - Past OKR-related conversations\n   - Analysis summaries and insights\n   - User questions and agent responses\n\n3. **Meeting Notes \u0026 Reports** (Future)\n   - OKR review meeting notes\n   - P\u0026L reports mentioning OKRs\n   - Strategic planning documents\n\n**Implementation Approach:**\n- Reuse existing pgvector infrastructure (same as document-rag.ts)\n- Create `okr_embeddings` table in Supabase\n- Use same embedding model (openai/text-embedding-3-small)\n- Create semantic search tool for OKR agent\n- Integrate with existing OKR workflows\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n### Step 1: Create OKR Embeddings Table Migration\n- Create migration file: `supabase/migrations/006_create_okr_embeddings_table.sql`\n- Enable pgvector extension (if not already enabled)\n- Create `okr_embeddings` table with:\n  - `id`, `user_id` (for RLS)\n  - `content` (text to embed: query results, summaries, notes)\n  - `embedding` vector(1536)\n  - `metadata` JSONB (source_type, period, company, etc.)\n  - `created_at`, `updated_at`\n- Add HNSW index for similarity search\n- Add RLS policies (users can only see their own data)\n\n### Step 2: Create OKR RAG Module\n- Create `lib/rag/okr-rag.ts` similar to `document-rag.ts`\n- Functions:\n  - `searchOkrBySemantic(query, userId, limit)` - Main search function\n  - `indexOkrData(metrics, summaries, userId)` - Index OKR data\n  - `formatOkrRagHits(hits)` - Format results for display\n- Support both vector search (when enabled) and keyword fallback\n- Use same Supabase PostgreSQL connection\n\n### Step 3: Create OKR Semantic Search Tool\n- Create `lib/tools/okr-semantic-search-tool.ts`\n- Tool signature: `tool({ description, parameters: { query, userId, limit }, execute })`\n- Returns formatted search results with relevance scores\n- Integrate with OKR Reviewer Agent\n\n### Step 4: Integrate with OKR Agent\n- Add `okrSemanticSearchTool` to OKR Reviewer Agent tools\n- Update agent instructions to mention semantic search capability\n- Test with sample queries\n\n### Step 5: Index Existing OKR Data\n- Create script to backfill embeddings for existing OKR data\n- Index recent OKR metrics summaries\n- Index past OKR conversation history\n- Set up incremental indexing for new data\n\n## Files to Create\n\n- `supabase/migrations/006_create_okr_embeddings_table.sql` - Database schema\n- `lib/rag/okr-rag.ts` - RAG search implementation\n- `lib/tools/okr-semantic-search-tool.ts` - Tool for OKR agent\n- `scripts/index-okr-data.ts` - Backfill script (optional)\n\n## Files to Update\n\n- `lib/agents/okr-reviewer-agent.ts` - Add semantic search tool\n- `lib/workflows/okr-analysis-workflow.ts` - Optionally use RAG for context\n\n## Configuration\n\n**Environment Variables:**\n```env\nOKR_RAG_USE_VECTOR=true  # Enable vector search (default: false, uses keyword fallback)\nOKR_RAG_VECTOR_TABLE=okr_embeddings  # Table name\nOKR_RAG_EMBEDDER=openai/text-embedding-3-small  # Embedding model\nSUPABASE_DATABASE_URL=...  # Already configured\n```\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- ✅ OKR embeddings table created with RLS\n- ✅ Semantic search tool works (vector or keyword fallback)\n- ✅ OKR agent can use semantic search\n- ✅ Can find relevant past OKR conversations\n- ✅ Can search across OKR metrics summaries\n- ✅ Performance acceptable (\u003c500ms per search)\n- ✅ RLS policies enforce user isolation\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Depends on: `setup-rag-documents` (completed) - Reuses same infrastructure\n- Blocks: None (can be done in parallel with observability)\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n1. **Unit Tests:**\n   - Test `searchOkrBySemantic()` with sample queries\n   - Test keyword fallback when vector unavailable\n   - Test RLS isolation (user A can't see user B's data)\n\n2. **Integration Tests:**\n   - Test tool integration with OKR agent\n   - Test end-to-end: query → search → agent response\n   - Test with real OKR data\n\n3. **Performance Tests:**\n   - Measure search latency (\u003c500ms target)\n   - Test with large datasets (1000+ embeddings)\n   - Verify index performance\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\n- Index meeting notes from Feishu docs\n- Index P\u0026L reports mentioning OKRs\n- Add temporal filtering (search by period)\n- Add company filtering (search by company)\n- GraphRAG for complex OKR relationships\n\n## Related Work\n\n- Document RAG implementation (`lib/rag/document-rag.ts`) - Use as reference\n- OKR workflows (`lib/workflows/okr-analysis-workflow.ts`) - Can integrate RAG\n- OKR Reviewer Agent (`lib/agents/okr-reviewer-agent.ts`) - Consumer of RAG tool","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-08T18:17:30.756137+08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-08T18:17:30.756137+08:00","source_repo":"."}

The root cause has not been properly diagnosed or fixed. We need to systematically identify and resolve the underlying issues.\n\n## WHAT WE'VE OBSERVED\n\n1. **Intermittent Startup Failures**: Server sometimes starts successfully, sometimes hangs\n2. **WebSocket Connection Issues**: Connection appears to establish but reliability is uncertain\n3. **Long Debugging Sessions**: We've spent extended time testing buttons, checking logs, restarting servers without identifying the root cause\n4. **Manual Workarounds**: We're using nohup, pid files, sleep commands - signs of working around problems rather than fixing them\n\n## IMPACT\n\n- Cannot reliably start the server for testing\n- Unclear if production deployment will have similar issues\n- Development velocity severely impacted by restarts and debugging\n- No clear diagnostic tools to understand what's happening\n\n## AREAS TO INVESTIGATE\n\n### 1. Server Startup Process\n- [ ] Check if initial WebSocket connection is blocking server startup\n- [ ] Look at initialization order in server.ts\n- [ ] Verify all dependencies are loaded before listening on port 3000\n- [ ] Check for race conditions in async initialization\n\n### 2. WebSocket Connection Handling\n- [ ] Verify Feishu SDK setup and initialization\n- [ ] Check if event-dispatch is fully ready before accepting events\n- [ ] Look at error handling for failed connections\n- [ ] Determine if WebSocket reconnection logic is working\n\n### 3. Environment and Dependencies\n- [ ] Verify Supabase is optional or gracefully skipped\n- [ ] Check if missing env vars are properly handled\n- [ ] Review all external service dependencies\n\n### 4. Logging and Diagnostics\n- [ ] Add detailed startup phase logging\n- [ ] Log WebSocket lifecycle events (connecting, connected, reconnecting, failed)\n- [ ] Add health check endpoint that shows detailed status\n- [ ] Log timing information to identify bottlenecks\n\n## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA\n\n- [ ] Server starts reliably 100% of the time (no hangs, no race conditions)\n- [ ] WebSocket connection status is clearly visible in logs\n- [ ] Health endpoint shows detailed startup and connection status\n- [ ] Can diagnose connection failures without inspecting code\n- [ ] Startup time is documented and predictable (\u003c10s)\n\n## TECHNICAL NOTES\n\n- Current startup code in server.ts appears to initialize WebSocket and Feishu SDK\n- Subscription Mode is being used (long-lived WebSocket instead of webhook polling)\n- There's a 5-8 second wait in AGENTS.md noted as \"startup time\" but actual behavior varies\n- No explicit timeout handling for WebSocket connection establishment\n\n## NEXT STEPS\n\n1. Add detailed logging to server.ts startup sequence\n2. Create startup verification tests\n3. Document expected startup phases and timing\n4. Add explicit error handling for connection failures\n5. Verify all startup warnings can be safely ignored","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-20T19:01:22.366615+08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-20T19:03:55.023249+08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-20T19:03:55.023249+08:00","source_repo":"."}

Check `lib/memory-mastra.ts` - verify semanticRecall.enabled = true\n   - Verify maxResults: 10 (appropriate for context window)\n   - Check that Memory instance is created with semantic recall config\n\n2. **Check Mastra Documentation**:\n   - Verify correct API for semantic recall\n   - Understand how embeddings are generated (automatic?)\n   - Check if any additional setup required\n\n3. **Verify Database Schema**:\n   - Check if Mastra creates semantic recall tables automatically\n   - Verify vector columns exist for message embeddings\n   - Check RLS policies are applied\n\n**Files to Review**:\n- `lib/memory-mastra.ts` - Current configuration\n- Mastra documentation (if available)\n\n**Success Criteria**:\n- ✅ Configuration verified correct\n- ✅ Database schema supports semantic recall\n- ✅ Vector columns exist for embeddings\n\n### Phase 2: Create Semantic Recall Test Script\n\n**What Needs to Be Done**:\n1. **Create Test Script**:\n   - Script to test storing conversations (should auto-embed)\n   - Script to test semantic search retrieval\n   - Script to test relevance (similar queries return similar conversations)\n   - Script to test user scoping (RLS)\n\n2. **Test Scenarios**:\n   - Store conversation about \"OKR analysis for Q3\"\n   - Query: \"What did we discuss about Q3 OKRs?\"\n   - Verify relevant conversation retrieved\n   - Query: \"Tell me about quarterly reviews\"\n   - Verify semantically similar conversations retrieved\n   - Verify user A can't see user B's conversations (RLS)\n\n**Files to Create**:\n- `test/memory/semantic-recall.test.ts` - Comprehensive tests\n- `scripts/test-semantic-recall.ts` - Manual test script\n\n**Success Criteria**:\n- ✅ Can store conversations (auto-embedded)\n- ✅ Can retrieve relevant conversations via semantic search\n- ✅ Retrieved conversations are semantically relevant\n- ✅ RLS isolation works (users can't see each other's conversations)\n- ✅ Performance acceptable (\u003c100ms for recall)\n\n### Phase 3: Verify Semantic Recall in Agent Usage\n\n**What Needs to Be Done**:\n1. **Check Current Agent Usage**:\n   - Review `lib/agents/manager-agent-mastra.ts` - check if semantic recall is used\n   - Check if agents load past conversations via memory.query()\n   - Verify semantic recall is actually being invoked\n\n2. **Test Agent Integration**:\n   - Create test conversation about \"OKR trends\"\n   - Ask follow-up question days later: \"What were those trends again?\"\n   - Verify agent retrieves relevant past conversation\n   - Verify response quality improves with retrieved context\n\n3. **Measure Impact**:\n   - Compare responses with/without semantic recall\n   - Measure token usage (should be lower with semantic recall)\n   - Measure response quality (should be better)\n\n**Files to Review/Update**:\n- `lib/agents/manager-agent-mastra.ts` - Verify semantic recall usage\n- Other agent files - Check if they use semantic recall\n\n**Success Criteria**:\n- ✅ Agents use semantic recall when querying memory\n- ✅ Retrieved context improves response quality\n- ✅ Token usage optimized (only relevant context retrieved)\n\n### Phase 4: Optimize Semantic Recall Performance\n\n**What Needs to Be Done**:\n1. **Benchmark Performance**:\n   - Measure semantic recall latency\n   - Identify bottlenecks\n   - Optimize if needed (indexes, query patterns)\n\n2. **Tune maxResults**:\n   - Test different maxResults values (5, 10, 20)\n   - Balance between context quality and token usage\n   - Choose optimal value based on results\n\n3. **Monitor Usage**:\n   - Track how often semantic recall is used\n   - Monitor performance in production\n   - Adjust configuration if needed\n\n**Files to Create/Update**:\n- `scripts/benchmark-semantic-recall.ts` - Performance benchmark\n- `lib/memory-mastra.ts` - Tune maxResults if needed\n\n**Success Criteria**:\n- ✅ Semantic recall latency \u003c100ms\n- ✅ Optimal maxResults value chosen\n- ✅ Performance monitoring in place\n\n### Phase 5: Document Semantic Recall Usage\n\n**What Needs to Be Done**:\n1. **Create Documentation**:\n   - How semantic recall works\n   - How it's automatically used by agents\n   - Configuration options\n   - Performance characteristics\n\n2. **Add Examples**:\n   - Example: Multi-turn conversation with semantic recall\n   - Example: Long conversation gap with recall\n   - Example: Measuring recall effectiveness\n\n**Files to Create**:\n- `docs/features/semantic-recall.md` - Documentation\n\n**Success Criteria**:\n- ✅ Documentation complete\n- ✅ Examples provided\n- ✅ Performance characteristics documented\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n**Semantic Recall Architecture**:\n- Mastra automatically embeds messages when stored\n- Vector search finds semantically similar past conversations\n- Retrieved conversations added to context window\n- RLS ensures user-scoped retrieval\n\n**Embedding Generation**:\n- Automatic (handled by Mastra)\n- Uses configured embedder (likely OpenAI text-embedding-3-small)\n- Embeddings stored in PostgreSQL with pgvector\n\n**Performance**:\n- Vector search is fast (\u003c10ms with HNSW index)\n- Embedding generation happens async (doesn't block)\n- maxResults limits context size (prevents token bloat)\n\n**Token Usage**:\n- Only relevant past conversations retrieved (not entire history)\n- Reduces token usage vs loading all history\n- Optimal balance between context and efficiency\n\n## Dependencies\n\n**Blocks**:\n- None (can be done independently)\n\n**Blocked By**:\n- None (semantic recall already configured)\n\n**Related Work**:\n- Memory system (`lib/memory-mastra.ts`) - Already configured\n- Vector store (`pgvector` migration) - Already enabled\n- Agent implementations - Will benefit from semantic recall\n- Working memory - Related memory feature (separate task)\n\n## Success Metrics\n\nAfter completion:\n- ✅ Semantic recall retrieves relevant past conversations\n- ✅ Retrieved context improves agent responses\n- ✅ Performance acceptable (\u003c100ms)\n- ✅ RLS isolation verified\n- ✅ Token usage optimized\n- ✅ Tests pass\n- ✅ Documentation complete\n\n## Risk Mitigation\n\n1. **Performance**: Monitor latency, optimize if needed\n2. **Relevance**: Test that retrieved conversations are actually relevant\n3. **RLS Safety**: Verify user isolation thoroughly\n4. **Token Usage**: Monitor to ensure maxResults doesn't bloat context\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\n- **Relevance Thresholding**: Only retrieve if similarity \u003e threshold\n- **Temporal Weighting**: Weight recent conversations higher\n- **Cross-Domain Recall**: Link OKR, P\u0026L, document conversations\n- **GraphRAG**: Model relationships between conversations","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-08T18:22:32.466907+08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-08T18:22:32.466907+08:00","source_repo":"."}

While this works for structured queries, it lacks the ability to:\n- Answer questions about historical OKR trends and patterns\n- Retrieve relevant context from past OKR reviews, meeting notes, or P\u0026L reports\n- Provide semantic search across OKR-related documents and conversations\n- Enable agents to learn from past OKR analysis patterns\n\n## Why This Matters\n\n**Project Goal Alignment**: This directly serves the core mission of building an intelligent Feishu AI assistant that can handle OKR review, P\u0026L analysis, and document tracking. RAG enables the assistant to be more contextually aware and provide better insights by learning from historical data.\n\n**Technical Benefits**:\n- **Better Context Retrieval**: Agents can find relevant past OKR reviews when answering new questions\n- **Semantic Understanding**: Users can ask \"What were the main issues last quarter?\" and get relevant historical context\n- **Knowledge Accumulation**: Past analyses become searchable knowledge that improves future responses\n- **Reduced Token Usage**: Only relevant historical context is retrieved, not entire conversation history\n\n**User Experience Benefits**:\n- More accurate answers by referencing past OKR reviews\n- Ability to track trends over time (\"How did Q3 compare to Q2?\")\n- Better recommendations based on historical patterns\n\n## Current State\n\n**What Exists**:\n- ✅ Document RAG infrastructure (`lib/rag/document-rag.ts`) - Can be used as template\n- ✅ pgvector migration (`005_enable_pgvector_and_document_embeddings.sql`) - Vector store ready\n- ✅ OKR data sources: DuckDB (`okr_metrics.db`), StarRocks (`okr_metrics` table)\n- ✅ OKR Reviewer Agent with analysis capabilities\n- ✅ OKR workflows (`okr-analysis-workflow.ts`) that query and analyze data\n\n**What's Missing**:\n- Vector embeddings for OKR data (metrics, reviews, analysis results)\n- Semantic search tool for OKR knowledge base\n- Integration of RAG into OKR Reviewer Agent\n- Workflow to populate embeddings from OKR data sources\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### Phase 1: Design OKR RAG Schema and Data Sources\n\n**What Needs to Be Done**:\n1. **Identify OKR Data Sources**:\n   - DuckDB `okr_metrics` table (structured metrics)\n   - StarRocks `okr_metrics` and `employee_fellow` tables\n   - Historical OKR analysis results (from past agent responses)\n   - Meeting notes or documents related to OKR reviews (if available)\n   - P\u0026L reports that reference OKR metrics (cross-domain knowledge)\n\n2. **Design Embedding Strategy**:\n   - **Structured Data**: Embed OKR metrics summaries (company, period, has_metric_percentage, key insights)\n   - **Analysis Results**: Embed past OKR analysis responses (agent-generated insights)\n   - **Metadata**: Include period, company, user_id for filtering\n   - **Chunking Strategy**: Determine optimal chunk size (likely 500-1000 tokens per chunk)\n\n3. **Define Vector Store Schema**:\n   - Table: `okr_embeddings` (similar to `document_embeddings`)\n   - Columns: `id`, `user_id`, `content`, `embedding vector(1536)`, `metadata JSONB`\n   - Metadata fields: `period`, `company`, `analysis_type`, `source` (duckdb/starrocks/analysis), `created_at`\n\n**Files to Create/Update**:\n- `supabase/migrations/006_create_okr_embeddings_table.sql` - New migration\n- `lib/rag/okr-rag.ts` - OKR-specific RAG implementation\n- `docs/design/okr-rag-architecture.md` - Design document (optional but recommended)\n\n**Success Criteria**:\n- ✅ Migration creates `okr_embeddings` table with RLS\n- ✅ Schema supports filtering by user_id, period, company\n- ✅ Metadata structure documented\n\n### Phase 2: Implement OKR Embedding Generation\n\n**What Needs to Be Done**:\n1. **Create Embedding Generation Function**:\n   - Query OKR metrics from DuckDB/StarRocks\n   - Format data into text chunks suitable for embedding\n   - Generate embeddings using OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (or configured embedder)\n   - Store embeddings in `okr_embeddings` table\n\n2. **Handle Different Data Sources**:\n   - **DuckDB**: Query `okr_metrics` table, format as \"Company X in Period Y: has_metric_percentage Z%, insights...\"\n   - **StarRocks**: Similar formatting for structured metrics\n   - **Analysis Results**: Embed past OKR analysis responses (if stored)\n   - **Incremental Updates**: Only embed new/changed data (track last_embedding_time)\n\n3. **User Scoping**:\n   - Respect RLS: Only embed data user has access to\n   - Use `getUserDataScope()` to filter by user permissions\n   - Store `user_id` for RLS enforcement\n\n**Files to Create**:\n- `lib/rag/okr-rag.ts` - Main OKR RAG implementation\n  - `generateOkrEmbeddings()` - Generate embeddings from OKR data\n  - `searchOkrKnowledge()` - Semantic search function\n  - `formatOkrDataForEmbedding()` - Convert structured data to text\n\n**Success Criteria**:\n- ✅ Can generate embeddings from DuckDB OKR metrics\n- ✅ Can generate embeddings from StarRocks OKR metrics\n- ✅ Embeddings stored with proper metadata and RLS\n- ✅ Incremental updates work (don't re-embed unchanged data)\n\n### Phase 3: Create OKR Semantic Search Tool\n\n**What Needs to Be Done**:\n1. **Create Vector Query Tool**:\n   - Use `createVectorQueryTool` from `@mastra/rag`\n   - Configure with PgVector store pointing to `okr_embeddings` table\n   - Set embedder to match embedding generation (text-embedding-3-small)\n\n2. **Implement Search Function**:\n   - Accept query string and optional filters (period, company, user_id)\n   - Perform vector similarity search\n   - Return top N results with scores and metadata\n   - Format results for agent consumption\n\n3. **Add Fallback**:\n   - If vector search fails or returns no results, fall back to keyword search\n   - Similar to document-rag.ts pattern\n\n**Files to Create**:\n- `lib/tools/okr-semantic-search-tool.ts` - Tool for agents to use\n- Update `lib/rag/okr-rag.ts` with search implementation\n\n**Success Criteria**:\n- ✅ Tool can be imported and used by agents\n- ✅ Returns relevant OKR context for queries\n- ✅ Respects user permissions (RLS)\n- ✅ Falls back gracefully if vector store unavailable\n\n### Phase 4: Integrate RAG into OKR Reviewer Agent\n\n**What Needs to Be Done**:\n1. **Add RAG Tool to OKR Agent**:\n   - Import `okrSemanticSearchTool` in `okr-reviewer-agent.ts`\n   - Add tool to agent's tools object\n   - Update agent instructions to mention RAG capability\n\n2. **Update Agent Instructions**:\n   - Explain when to use semantic search (historical questions, trend analysis)\n   - Guide agent to combine RAG results with fresh data queries\n   - Example: \"For questions about past quarters, use okrSemanticSearch to find relevant historical context\"\n\n3. **Test Integration**:\n   - Query: \"What were the main OKR issues last quarter?\"\n   - Verify agent uses RAG tool and combines with current data\n   - Verify response quality improves with historical context\n\n**Files to Update**:\n- `lib/agents/okr-reviewer-agent.ts` - Add RAG tool\n- `lib/agents/okr-reviewer-agent-mastra.ts` - Add RAG tool (if separate)\n\n**Success Criteria**:\n- ✅ OKR agent can use semantic search tool\n- ✅ Agent instructions guide proper RAG usage\n- ✅ Test queries show improved responses with historical context\n\n### Phase 5: Populate Initial Embeddings and Set Up Maintenance\n\n**What Needs to Be Done**:\n1. **Create Initial Population Script**:\n   - Script to generate embeddings for existing OKR data\n   - Can be run once to bootstrap the knowledge base\n   - Should handle large datasets (batch processing)\n\n2. **Set Up Incremental Updates**:\n   - Hook into OKR analysis workflow to generate embeddings for new analyses\n   - Or set up periodic job to sync new OKR metrics\n   - Track what's been embedded (avoid duplicates)\n\n3. **Documentation**:\n   - How to populate embeddings\n   - How to maintain/update embeddings\n   - How to query/use the RAG system\n\n**Files to Create**:\n- `scripts/populate-okr-embeddings.ts` - Initial population script\n- `docs/setup/okr-rag-setup.md` - Setup and maintenance guide\n\n**Success Criteria**:\n- ✅ Can populate embeddings from existing OKR data\n- ✅ Incremental updates work (new analyses get embedded)\n- ✅ Documentation complete\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n**Vector Store**:\n- Uses same Supabase PostgreSQL as document RAG\n- Reuses pgvector extension (already enabled)\n- Separate table (`okr_embeddings`) for OKR-specific data\n- RLS policies ensure user data isolation\n\n**Embedding Model**:\n- Default: `openai/text-embedding-3-small` (1536 dimensions)\n- Configurable via `OKR_RAG_EMBEDDER` env var\n- Cost: ~$0.02 per 1M tokens (very affordable for OKR data)\n\n**Performance**:\n- HNSW index for fast similarity search (\u003c10ms for typical queries)\n- Batch embedding generation for initial population\n- Incremental updates avoid re-processing unchanged data\n\n**Data Privacy**:\n- RLS ensures users only see their own OKR embeddings\n- User-scoped queries via `getUserDataScope()`\n- No cross-user data leakage\n\n## Dependencies\n\n**Blocks**:\n- None (can be done independently)\n\n**Blocked By**:\n- None (document RAG already provides template)\n\n**Related Work**:\n- Document RAG implementation (`lib/rag/document-rag.ts`) -

Store user preference: \"prefers_charts: bar\"\n   - Store learned fact: \"user_company: CompanyX\"\n   - Retrieve stored facts\n   - Verify facts persist after server restart\n   - Verify user A can't see user B's facts (RLS)\n\n**Files to Create**:\n- `test/memory/working-memory.test.ts` - Comprehensive tests\n- `scripts/test-working-memory.ts` - Manual test script\n\n**Success Criteria**:\n- ✅ Can store working memory facts\n- ✅ Can retrieve working memory facts\n- ✅ RLS isolation works (users can't see each other's facts)\n- ✅ Facts persist across sessions\n\n### Phase 3: Integrate Working Memory into Agents\n\n**What Needs to Be Done**:\n1. **Add Working Memory Usage to Manager Agent**:\n   - Store user preferences when detected (\"I prefer charts\")\n   - Retrieve user preferences before generating response\n   - Use preferences to customize agent behavior\n\n2. **Add Working Memory Usage to OKR Agent**:\n   - Store chart format preference\n   - Store period preference (if user always asks for specific period)\n   - Retrieve preferences to customize analysis\n\n3. **Update Agent Instructions**:\n   - Guide agents to store learned facts\n   - Guide agents to retrieve and use stored preferences\n   - Example: \"If user mentions a preference, store it in working memory\"\n\n**Files to Update**:\n- `lib/agents/manager-agent-mastra.ts` - Add working memory usage\n- `lib/agents/okr-reviewer-agent.ts` - Add working memory usage\n- Other specialist agents (as needed)\n\n**Implementation Pattern**:\n```typescript\n// Store preference\nawait mastraMemory.setWorkingMemory({\n  resourceId: memoryResource,\n  key: 'chart_preference',\n  value: 'bar',\n});\n\n// Retrieve preference\nconst preference = await mastraMemory.getWorkingMemory({\n  resourceId: memoryResource,\n  key: 'chart_preference',\n});\n```\n\n**Success Criteria**:\n- ✅ Agents can store user preferences\n- ✅ Agents can retrieve and use preferences\n- ✅ Preferences affect agent behavior\n- ✅ User preferences persist across conversations\n\n### Phase 4: Create Working Memory Helper Functions\n\n**What Needs to Be Done**:\n1. **Create Helper Module**:\n   - `lib/memory/working-memory-helpers.ts`\n   - Helper functions for common working memory operations\n   - Type-safe interfaces for stored facts\n\n2. **Common Operations**:\n   - `storeUserPreference(userId, key, value)` - Store preference\n   - `getUserPreference(userId, key)` - Get preference\n   - `storeLearnedFact(userId, fact)` - Store learned fact\n   - `getUserFacts(userId)` - Get all user facts\n\n3. **Type Definitions**:\n   - Define common preference keys (chart_format, language, etc.)\n   - Define fact structure\n   - Type-safe accessors\n\n**Files to Create**:\n- `lib/memory/working-memory-helpers.ts` - Helper functions\n\n**Success Criteria**:\n- ✅ Helper functions work correctly\n- ✅ Type-safe interfaces defined\n- ✅ Easy to use from agents\n\n### Phase 5: Document Working Memory Usage\n\n**What Needs to Be Done**:\n1. **Create Documentation**:\n   - How working memory works\n   - How to store/retrieve facts\n   - Common use cases\n   - Best practices\n\n2. **Add Examples**:\n   - Example: Storing chart preference\n   - Example: Storing user company\n   - Example: Retrieving preferences in agent\n\n**Files to Create**:\n- `docs/features/working-memory.md` - Documentation\n\n**Success Criteria**:\n- ✅ Documentation complete\n- ✅ Examples provided\n- ✅ Best practices documented\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n**Working Memory Storage**:\n- Stored in PostgreSQL via Mastra Memory\n- Scoped by resourceId (user_id)\n- Format: markdown (flexible for storing facts)\n- RLS ensures user isolation\n\n**Data Structure**:\n- Key-value pairs (preferences)\n- Free-form facts (learned information)\n- Metadata (when stored, by which agent)\n\n**Performance**:\n- Working memory queries are fast (\u003c10ms)\n- Cached in memory for frequently accessed facts\n- No impact on agent response time\n\n**Privacy**:\n- RLS ensures users only see their own facts\n- No cross-user data access\n- Compliant with data privacy requirements\n\n## Dependencies\n\n**Blocks**:\n- None (can be done independently)\n\n**Blocked By**:\n- None (working memory already configured)\n\n**Related Work**:\n- Memory system (`lib/memory-mastra.ts`) - Already configured\n- Agent implementations - Will consume working memory\n- Semantic recall - Related memory feature (separate task)\n\n## Success Metrics\n\nAfter completion:\n- ✅ Working memory stores and retrieves data correctly\n- ✅ User preferences persist across conversations\n- ✅ Agents use working memory to personalize responses\n- ✅ RLS isolation verified (users can't see each other's facts)\n- ✅ Tests pass\n- ✅ Documentation complete\n\n## Risk Mitigation\n\n1. **Configuration Issues**: Verify Mastra API matches our usage\n2. **RLS Safety**: Test thoroughly to ensure no data leakage\n3. **Performance**: Monitor working memory query latency\n4. **Data Migration**: If schema changes, plan migration path\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\n- **Fact Expiration**: Auto-expire old facts after N days\n- **Fact Validation**: Validate facts before storing\n- **Fact Relationships**: Link related facts (GraphRAG)\n- **Bulk Operations**: Store/retrieve multiple facts at once","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-08T18:21:49.709711+08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-08T18:21:49.709711+08:00","source_repo":"."}

Users expect agents to remember previous messages and use them to inform responses. Without memory, each message is stateless and context is lost.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION PLAN:\n1. Test multi-turn conversation (Q1→A1, Q2→A2 with context awareness)\n2. Verify RLS/user scoping prevents cross-user contamination\n3. Test graceful fallback when memory backend unavailable\n4. Verify InMemoryProvider used in test environments\n5. Ensure memory failures don't crash agents\n\nACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:\n✓ Multi-turn conversation maintains context (agent acknowledges prior messages)\n✓ Different users have completely isolated memory (User A can't see User B's chats)\n✓ Tests pass with both Supabase backend and InMemory fallback\n✓ Memory operations fail gracefully with warnings\n✓ Agents continue operating if memory unavailable\n\nCONTEXT:\n- Memory integration added to manager agent (manager-agent-mastra.ts:166-182)\n- Conversation scoped by: feishu:${chatId}:${rootId}\n- User scoped by: user:${userId}\n- Graceful fallback to InMemoryProvider when SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL not set\n- Known issue: DrizzleProvider schema validation fails in tests (but doesn't crash)\n\nKNOWN ISSUES \u0026 MITIGATIONS:\n- DrizzleProvider expects schema tables that don't exist in test DB\n  → Gracefully catches errors and continues (try-catch wrapper)\n  → Only affects test environment; production Supabase works fine\n- Memory save operations are async and wrapped in try-catch\n  → If save fails, agent continues; warning logged\n  → Follows 'fail-open' principle (availability \u003e consistency for this use case)\n\nTECHNICAL NOTES:\n- Uses @ai-sdk-tools/memory DrizzleProvider with Supabase backend\n- Message save uses ConversationMessage format: {chatId, userId, role, content, timestamp}\n- Conversation history limited to 5 messages (configurable in loadConversationHistory)\n- Working memory stored as JSON string (for future learned facts storage)\n\nFUTURE WORK:\n- Add semantic similarity search for message retrieval\n- Implement working memory updates (track user preferences, learned facts)\n- Add conversation summarization for long threads\n- Test with actual Feishu multi-turn conversations","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-27T15:14:59.085716+08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-27T15:25:13.841418+08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-27T15:25:13.841418+08:00","source_repo":".","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"feishu_assistant-t7h","depends_on_id":"feishu_assistant-0c7","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-11-27T15:14:59.087032+08:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}
