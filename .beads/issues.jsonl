We're migrating to Mastra framework to:\n\n1. **Simplify agent architecture** - Native model fallback arrays eliminate dual-agent pattern\n2. **Improve observability** - Mastra AI Tracing designed specifically for LLM operations (vs custom devtools)\n3. **Modernize tech stack** - Mastra is actively developed with 18.5k GitHub stars, strong community\n4. **Reduce code complexity** - Remove ~500 lines of handoff routing + dual agent management\n5. **Unify memory system** - Mastra memory + PostgreSQL replaces ai-sdk-tools + Supabase+Drizzle\n\n## Long-Term Goals This Serves\n\n1. **Production readiness** - Move to actively maintained framework with better observability\n2. **Scalability** - PostgreSQL memory backend scales better than Drizzle+Supabase for concurrent users\n3. **Team knowledge** - Mastra becoming de facto standard in AI agent community (LLM layer unification)\n4. **Developer velocity** - Simpler codebase = faster feature development + fewer bugs\n5. **Cost optimization** - Consolidated observability (Langfuse) vs custom devtools + Feishu logging\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### Current State (ai-sdk-tools)\n- Dual agents (primary + fallback) for model fallback\n- Custom devtools tracking (~300 lines of tracking code)\n- ai-sdk-tools memory with Supabase backend\n- Manual agent handoff routing with regex patterns\n- Cache layer with TTL support\n\n### Target State (Mastra)\n- Single agent with model array fallback (auto-managed by Mastra)\n- Native AI Tracing with multiple exporter options (Langfuse, Braintrust, OTEL)\n- Mastra memory with PostgreSQL backend\n- Native Mastra workflow/agent switching (no custom routing needed)\n- Mastra built-in caching\n\n### Compatibility Notes\n- Tools already use universal tool() signature from 'ai' package - no changes needed\n- Memory migration is bidirectional (can coexist initially)\n- Observability improvements are backwards compatible\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\n### Phase 1: Setup \u0026 Infrastructure (Days 1-2)\n- Add Mastra observability config (PinoLogger, AI Tracing)\n- Verify PostgreSQL schema for Mastra memory\n- Test connection pooling and transaction handling\n\n### Phase 2: Agent Migration (Days 3-5)\n- Migrate Manager Agent (highest impact, orchestrator)\n- Migrate specialist agents (OKR, Alignment, P\u0026L, DPA-PM)\n- No changes needed for tools (already compatible)\n\n### Phase 3: Memory \u0026 State (Day 6)\n- Transition conversation history to Mastra memory\n- Verify RLS still works correctly\n- Run dual-read tests (both memory systems)\n\n### Phase 4: Observability (Day 7)\n- Configure Langfuse exporter\n- Set up real-time tracing (dev) + batch mode (prod)\n- Retire custom devtools-integration.ts\n\n### Phase 5: Testing \u0026 Validation (Days 8-10)\n- Unit tests for all migrated agents\n- Integration tests (multi-turn, memory persistence)\n- E2E tests (full Feishu workflow)\n- Performance regression testing\n\n### Phase 6: Cleanup (Day 11)\n- Remove ai-sdk-tools dependencies (if not used elsewhere)\n- Deprecate custom implementations\n- Update documentation and team knowledge base\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n1. ✅ All 5 agents working with Mastra (unit test passing)\n2. ✅ Memory fully transitioned (integration tests passing)\n3. ✅ Observability provides equal or better insights\n4. ✅ No regression in response times (performance tests)\n5. ✅ All tests passing in CI/CD\n6. ✅ Code review approved\n7. ✅ Deployed to production with monitoring\n8. ✅ ai-sdk-tools removed (if applicable)\n\n## Risk Mitigation\n\n1. **Keep both frameworks during transition** - Run tests against both implementations\n2. **Gradual rollout** - Migrate agents one by one, not all at once\n3. **Memory coexistence** - Support both memory backends during transition period\n4. **Rollback ready** - Keep ai-sdk-tools in package.json until fully validated in production\n5. **Monitoring** - Enhanced observability helps catch issues faster\n\n## External References\n\n- [Mastra Documentation](https://mastra.ai/docs)\n- [Mastra AI Tracing](https://mastra.ai/docs/observability/ai-tracing/overview)\n- [Langfuse Integration](https://mastra.ai/docs/observability/ai-tracing/exporters/langfuse)\n- [Mastra Memory System](https://mastra.ai/docs/memory)\n- [Current Implementation Plan](./MASTRA_MIGRATION_PLAN.md)","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-02T12:48:49.721838+08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-02T12:49:08.849454+08:00","source_repo":"."}

Historical OKR metrics tables (okr_metrics_*)\n   - Company performance data\n   - Employee/fellow data\n   - Query results and analysis summaries\n\n2. **Conversation History**\n   - Past OKR-related conversations\n   - Analysis summaries and insights\n   - User questions and agent responses\n\n3. **Meeting Notes \u0026 Reports** (Future)\n   - OKR review meeting notes\n   - P\u0026L reports mentioning OKRs\n   - Strategic planning documents\n\n**Implementation Approach:**\n- Reuse existing pgvector infrastructure (same as document-rag.ts)\n- Create `okr_embeddings` table in Supabase\n- Use same embedding model (openai/text-embedding-3-small)\n- Create semantic search tool for OKR agent\n- Integrate with existing OKR workflows\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n### Step 1: Create OKR Embeddings Table Migration\n- Create migration file: `supabase/migrations/006_create_okr_embeddings_table.sql`\n- Enable pgvector extension (if not already enabled)\n- Create `okr_embeddings` table with:\n  - `id`, `user_id` (for RLS)\n  - `content` (text to embed: query results, summaries, notes)\n  - `embedding` vector(1536)\n  - `metadata` JSONB (source_type, period, company, etc.)\n  - `created_at`, `updated_at`\n- Add HNSW index for similarity search\n- Add RLS policies (users can only see their own data)\n\n### Step 2: Create OKR RAG Module\n- Create `lib/rag/okr-rag.ts` similar to `document-rag.ts`\n- Functions:\n  - `searchOkrBySemantic(query, userId, limit)` - Main search function\n  - `indexOkrData(metrics, summaries, userId)` - Index OKR data\n  - `formatOkrRagHits(hits)` - Format results for display\n- Support both vector search (when enabled) and keyword fallback\n- Use same Supabase PostgreSQL connection\n\n### Step 3: Create OKR Semantic Search Tool\n- Create `lib/tools/okr-semantic-search-tool.ts`\n- Tool signature: `tool({ description, parameters: { query, userId, limit }, execute })`\n- Returns formatted search results with relevance scores\n- Integrate with OKR Reviewer Agent\n\n### Step 4: Integrate with OKR Agent\n- Add `okrSemanticSearchTool` to OKR Reviewer Agent tools\n- Update agent instructions to mention semantic search capability\n- Test with sample queries\n\n### Step 5: Index Existing OKR Data\n- Create script to backfill embeddings for existing OKR data\n- Index recent OKR metrics summaries\n- Index past OKR conversation history\n- Set up incremental indexing for new data\n\n## Files to Create\n\n- `supabase/migrations/006_create_okr_embeddings_table.sql` - Database schema\n- `lib/rag/okr-rag.ts` - RAG search implementation\n- `lib/tools/okr-semantic-search-tool.ts` - Tool for OKR agent\n- `scripts/index-okr-data.ts` - Backfill script (optional)\n\n## Files to Update\n\n- `lib/agents/okr-reviewer-agent.ts` - Add semantic search tool\n- `lib/workflows/okr-analysis-workflow.ts` - Optionally use RAG for context\n\n## Configuration\n\n**Environment Variables:**\n```env\nOKR_RAG_USE_VECTOR=true  # Enable vector search (default: false, uses keyword fallback)\nOKR_RAG_VECTOR_TABLE=okr_embeddings  # Table name\nOKR_RAG_EMBEDDER=openai/text-embedding-3-small  # Embedding model\nSUPABASE_DATABASE_URL=...  # Already configured\n```\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- ✅ OKR embeddings table created with RLS\n- ✅ Semantic search tool works (vector or keyword fallback)\n- ✅ OKR agent can use semantic search\n- ✅ Can find relevant past OKR conversations\n- ✅ Can search across OKR metrics summaries\n- ✅ Performance acceptable (\u003c500ms per search)\n- ✅ RLS policies enforce user isolation\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Depends on: `setup-rag-documents` (completed) - Reuses same infrastructure\n- Blocks: None (can be done in parallel with observability)\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n1. **Unit Tests:**\n   - Test `searchOkrBySemantic()` with sample queries\n   - Test keyword fallback when vector unavailable\n   - Test RLS isolation (user A can't see user B's data)\n\n2. **Integration Tests:**\n   - Test tool integration with OKR agent\n   - Test end-to-end: query → search → agent response\n   - Test with real OKR data\n\n3. **Performance Tests:**\n   - Measure search latency (\u003c500ms target)\n   - Test with large datasets (1000+ embeddings)\n   - Verify index performance\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\n- Index meeting notes from Feishu docs\n- Index P\u0026L reports mentioning OKRs\n- Add temporal filtering (search by period)\n- Add company filtering (search by company)\n- GraphRAG for complex OKR relationships\n\n## Related Work\n\n- Document RAG implementation (`lib/rag/document-rag.ts`) - Use as reference\n- OKR workflows (`lib/workflows/okr-analysis-workflow.ts`) - Can integrate RAG\n- OKR Reviewer Agent (`lib/agents/okr-reviewer-agent.ts`) - Consumer of RAG tool","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-08T18:17:30.756137+08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-08T18:17:30.756137+08:00","source_repo":"."}

Step/output limits\n3. RLS-filtered file map (user only sees allowed data)\n\n## Integration with Agents\n\n```typescript\n// In pnl-agent-mastra.ts\nimport { bashExecTool } from '../tools/bash-exec-tool';\nimport { executeSqlTool } from '../tools/execute-sql-tool';\n\nexport const pnlAgent = new Agent({\n  name: 'pnl_analyst',\n  model: openrouter('anthropic/claude-sonnet'),\n  instructions: `You are a P\u0026L analyst.

All agents should:\n- Use the same exploration patterns\n- Have similar instruction structure\n- Follow common best practices\n\nThis document becomes our reference for:\n- Migrating remaining agents\n- Training new agents\n- Debugging agent behavior\n\n## Content to Document\n\n### 1. Standard Instruction Template\n\n```markdown\nYou are a [ROLE] for the Feishu assistant.\n\n## Your Workflow\n\n1. **EXPLORE FIRST**: Before writing any SQL, use bash to understand the data model:\n   - ls /semantic-layer/metrics/ - List available metrics\n   - ls /semantic-layer/entities/ - List available tables\n   - grep -r \"[term]\" /semantic-layer/ - Find relevant definitions\n   - cat /semantic-layer/[path] - Read specific file\n\n2. **CHECK EXAMPLES**: Look at example queries:\n   - ls /[domain]/examples/\n   - cat /[domain]/examples/[relevant].sql\n\n3. **UNDERSTAND TERMS**: Check glossary:\n   - cat /docs/glossary/[domain]_terms.md\n\n4. **WRITE SQL**: Based on exploration, construct query\n5. **EXECUTE**: Run via execute_sql\n6. **INTERPRET**: Provide insights in user's language\n\n## Key Principles\n- NEVER guess at column names - verify via cat\n- ALWAYS check metric definitions for correct calculations\n- Use Chinese when responding to Chinese queries\n```\n\n### 2. Common Bash Patterns\n\n| Task | Command |\n|------|---------|\n| List metrics | ls /semantic-layer/metrics/ |\n| Search for term | grep -r \"revenue\" /semantic-layer/ |\n| Read definition | cat /semantic-layer/metrics/revenue.yaml |\n| Check examples | cat /pnl/examples/quarterly_comparison.sql |\n| Write SQL | cat \u003e /workspace/query.sql \u003c\u003c 'EOF'...EOF |\n| Preview result | head -20 /workspace/result.csv |\n\n### 3. Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n| Don't | Instead |\n|-------|---------|\n| Hardcode table names | Explore /semantic-layer/entities/ first |\n| Assume column names | Read entity YAML for columns |\n| Skip exploration | Always ls/grep before writing SQL |\n| Ignore examples | Check /[domain]/examples/ for patterns |\n| Guess calculations | Read metric YAML for sql_expression |\n\n### 4. Debugging Patterns\n\nWhen SQL fails:\n```bash\n# Check table exists\ngrep -r \"[table_name]\" /semantic-layer/entities/\n\n# Check column exists\ncat /semantic-layer/entities/[table].yaml | grep \"[column]\"\n\n# Review similar examples\nls /[domain]/examples/\n```\n\n### 5. Multi-Step Reasoning Example\n\n```\nUser: \"Compare Q4 vs Q3 gross profit margin by BU\"\n\nAgent Thought Process:\n1. Need: gross_profit metric, by quarter and BU\n2. Explore: grep -r \"gross_profit\" /semantic-layer/\n3. Read: cat /semantic-layer/metrics/gross_profit.yaml\n4. Check example: cat /pnl/examples/quarterly_comparison.sql\n5. Adapt SQL for GP margin calculation\n6. Execute and format as table\n```\n\n## Files to Create\n- docs/architecture/AGENT_PROMPT_PATTERNS.md\n\n## Time Estimate: 2 hours","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-29T19:15:58.747848+08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-29T19:15:58.747848+08:00","source_repo":".","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"feishu_assistant-5u08","depends_on_id":"feishu_assistant-yx8m","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-29T19:15:58.749674+08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"feishu_assistant-5u08","depends_on_id":"feishu_assistant-lvna","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-12-29T19:15:58.750748+08:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

The root cause has not been properly diagnosed or fixed. We need to systematically identify and resolve the underlying issues.\n\n## WHAT WE'VE OBSERVED\n\n1. **Intermittent Startup Failures**: Server sometimes starts successfully, sometimes hangs\n2. **WebSocket Connection Issues**: Connection appears to establish but reliability is uncertain\n3. **Long Debugging Sessions**: We've spent extended time testing buttons, checking logs, restarting servers without identifying the root cause\n4. **Manual Workarounds**: We're using nohup, pid files, sleep commands - signs of working around problems rather than fixing them\n\n## IMPACT\n\n- Cannot reliably start the server for testing\n- Unclear if production deployment will have similar issues\n- Development velocity severely impacted by restarts and debugging\n- No clear diagnostic tools to understand what's happening\n\n## AREAS TO INVESTIGATE\n\n### 1. Server Startup Process\n- [ ] Check if initial WebSocket connection is blocking server startup\n- [ ] Look at initialization order in server.ts\n- [ ] Verify all dependencies are loaded before listening on port 3000\n- [ ] Check for race conditions in async initialization\n\n### 2. WebSocket Connection Handling\n- [ ] Verify Feishu SDK setup and initialization\n- [ ] Check if event-dispatch is fully ready before accepting events\n- [ ] Look at error handling for failed connections\n- [ ] Determine if WebSocket reconnection logic is working\n\n### 3. Environment and Dependencies\n- [ ] Verify Supabase is optional or gracefully skipped\n- [ ] Check if missing env vars are properly handled\n- [ ] Review all external service dependencies\n\n### 4. Logging and Diagnostics\n- [ ] Add detailed startup phase logging\n- [ ] Log WebSocket lifecycle events (connecting, connected, reconnecting, failed)\n- [ ] Add health check endpoint that shows detailed status\n- [ ] Log timing information to identify bottlenecks\n\n## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA\n\n- [ ] Server starts reliably 100% of the time (no hangs, no race conditions)\n- [ ] WebSocket connection status is clearly visible in logs\n- [ ] Health endpoint shows detailed startup and connection status\n- [ ] Can diagnose connection failures without inspecting code\n- [ ] Startup time is documented and predictable (\u003c10s)\n\n## TECHNICAL NOTES\n\n- Current startup code in server.ts appears to initialize WebSocket and Feishu SDK\n- Subscription Mode is being used (long-lived WebSocket instead of webhook polling)\n- There's a 5-8 second wait in AGENTS.md noted as \"startup time\" but actual behavior varies\n- No explicit timeout handling for WebSocket connection establishment\n\n## NEXT STEPS\n\n1.

Check `lib/memory-mastra.ts` - verify semanticRecall.enabled = true\n   - Verify maxResults: 10 (appropriate for context window)\n   - Check that Memory instance is created with semantic recall config\n\n2. **Check Mastra Documentation**:\n   - Verify correct API for semantic recall\n   - Understand how embeddings are generated (automatic?)\n   - Check if any additional setup required\n\n3. **Verify Database Schema**:\n   - Check if Mastra creates semantic recall tables automatically\n   - Verify vector columns exist for message embeddings\n   - Check RLS policies are applied\n\n**Files to Review**:\n- `lib/memory-mastra.ts` - Current configuration\n- Mastra documentation (if available)\n\n**Success Criteria**:\n- ✅ Configuration verified correct\n- ✅ Database schema supports semantic recall\n- ✅ Vector columns exist for embeddings\n\n### Phase 2: Create Semantic Recall Test Script\n\n**What Needs to Be Done**:\n1. **Create Test Script**:\n   - Script to test storing conversations (should auto-embed)\n   - Script to test semantic search retrieval\n   - Script to test relevance (similar queries return similar conversations)\n   - Script to test user scoping (RLS)\n\n2. **Test Scenarios**:\n   - Store conversation about \"OKR analysis for Q3\"\n   - Query: \"What did we discuss about Q3 OKRs?\"\n   - Verify relevant conversation retrieved\n   - Query: \"Tell me about quarterly reviews\"\n   - Verify semantically similar conversations retrieved\n   - Verify user A can't see user B's conversations (RLS)\n\n**Files to Create**:\n- `test/memory/semantic-recall.test.ts` - Comprehensive tests\n- `scripts/test-semantic-recall.ts` - Manual test script\n\n**Success Criteria**:\n- ✅ Can store conversations (auto-embedded)\n- ✅ Can retrieve relevant conversations via semantic search\n- ✅ Retrieved conversations are semantically relevant\n- ✅ RLS isolation works (users can't see each other's conversations)\n- ✅ Performance acceptable (\u003c100ms for recall)\n\n### Phase 3: Verify Semantic Recall in Agent Usage\n\n**What Needs to Be Done**:\n1. **Check Current Agent Usage**:\n   - Review `lib/agents/manager-agent-mastra.ts` - check if semantic recall is used\n   - Check if agents load past conversations via memory.query()\n   - Verify semantic recall is actually being invoked\n\n2. **Test Agent Integration**:\n   - Create test conversation about \"OKR trends\"\n   - Ask follow-up question days later: \"What were those trends again?\"\n   - Verify agent retrieves relevant past conversation\n   - Verify response quality improves with retrieved context\n\n3. **Measure Impact**:\n   - Compare responses with/without semantic recall\n   - Measure token usage (should be lower with semantic recall)\n   - Measure response quality (should be better)\n\n**Files to Review/Update**:\n- `lib/agents/manager-agent-mastra.ts` - Verify semantic recall usage\n- Other agent files - Check if they use semantic recall\n\n**Success Criteria**:\n- ✅ Agents use semantic recall when querying memory\n- ✅ Retrieved context improves response quality\n- ✅ Token usage optimized (only relevant context retrieved)\n\n### Phase 4: Optimize Semantic Recall Performance\n\n**What Needs to Be Done**:\n1. **Benchmark Performance**:\n   - Measure semantic recall latency\n   - Identify bottlenecks\n   - Optimize if needed (indexes, query patterns)\n\n2. **Tune maxResults**:\n   - Test different maxResults values (5, 10, 20)\n   - Balance between context quality and token usage\n   - Choose optimal value based on results\n\n3. **Monitor Usage**:\n   - Track how often semantic recall is used\n   - Monitor performance in production\n   - Adjust configuration if needed\n\n**Files to Create/Update**:\n- `scripts/benchmark-semantic-recall.ts` - Performance benchmark\n- `lib/memory-mastra.ts` - Tune maxResults if needed\n\n**Success Criteria**:\n- ✅ Semantic recall latency \u003c100ms\n- ✅ Optimal maxResults value chosen\n- ✅ Performance monitoring in place\n\n### Phase 5: Document Semantic Recall Usage\n\n**What Needs to Be Done**:\n1. **Create Documentation**:\n   - How semantic recall works\n   - How it's automatically used by agents\n   - Configuration options\n   - Performance characteristics\n\n2. **Add Examples**:\n   - Example: Multi-turn conversation with semantic recall\n   - Example: Long conversation gap with recall\n   - Example: Measuring recall effectiveness\n\n**Files to Create**:\n- `docs/features/semantic-recall.md` - Documentation\n\n**Success Criteria**:\n- ✅ Documentation complete\n- ✅ Examples provided\n- ✅ Performance characteristics documented\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n**Semantic Recall Architecture**:\n- Mastra automatically embeds messages when stored\n- Vector search finds semantically similar past conversations\n- Retrieved conversations added to context window\n- RLS ensures user-scoped retrieval\n\n**Embedding Generation**:\n- Automatic (handled by Mastra)\n- Uses configured embedder (likely OpenAI text-embedding-3-small)\n- Embeddings stored in PostgreSQL with pgvector\n\n**Performance**:\n- Vector search is fast (\u003c10ms with HNSW index)\n- Embedding generation happens async (doesn't block)\n- maxResults limits context size (prevents token bloat)\n\n**Token Usage**:\n- Only relevant past conversations retrieved (not entire history)\n- Reduces token usage vs loading all history\n- Optimal balance between context and efficiency\n\n## Dependencies\n\n**Blocks**:\n- None (can be done independently)\n\n**Blocked By**:\n- None (semantic recall already configured)\n\n**Related Work**:\n- Memory system (`lib/memory-mastra.ts`) - Already configured\n- Vector store (`pgvector` migration) - Already enabled\n- Agent implementations - Will benefit from semantic recall\n- Working memory - Related memory feature (separate task)\n\n## Success Metrics\n\nAfter completion:\n- ✅ Semantic recall retrieves relevant past conversations\n- ✅ Retrieved context improves agent responses\n- ✅ Performance acceptable (\u003c100ms)\n- ✅ RLS isolation verified\n- ✅ Token usage optimized\n- ✅ Tests pass\n- ✅ Documentation complete\n\n## Risk Mitigation\n\n1. **Performance**: Monitor latency, optimize if needed\n2. **Relevance**: Test that retrieved conversations are actually relevant\n3. **RLS Safety**: Verify user isolation thoroughly\n4. **Token Usage**: Monitor to ensure maxResults doesn't bloat context\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\n- **Relevance Thresholding**: Only retrieve if similarity \u003e threshold\n- **Temporal Weighting**: Weight recent conversations higher\n- **Cross-Domain Recall**: Link OKR, P\u0026L, document conversations\n- **GraphRAG**: Model relationships between conversations","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-08T18:22:32.466907+08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-08T18:22:32.466907+08:00","source_repo":"."}

(should remember OKR context)\n  Verify: A2 shows awareness of Q1\n\nScenario 2: User Isolation\n  User A asks Q about OKRs → stores in User A memory\n  User B asks same Q → should NOT see User A's prior responses\n  Verify: Different responses for same question by different users\n\nScenario 3: Thread Isolation\n  Same chat, but rootId changes (different threads)\n  Thread 1: Q about OKRs\n  Thread 2: Same question (should not remember Thread 1)\n  Verify: Separate memory per rootId\n\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n- Write in manager-agent-mastra.test.ts or new integration-test.ts\n- Pattern: 3 calls with same chatId/rootId, different questions\n- Check conversation history loaded before second call\n- Verify memory isolation with different IDs\n\nKNOWN ISSUES:\n- Tests may timeout due to API latency (5+ seconds each)\n- Memory writes may fail in test environment (expected, caught gracefully)\n- DrizzleProvider may error (but falls back to InMemory)\n\nCONTEXT:\n- Memory initialization done (manager-agent-mastra.ts:166-182)\n- loadConversationHistory() loads last 5 messages\n- saveMessageToMemory() saves user and assistant messages\n- Memory scoped by: feishu:${chatId}:${rootId} and user:${userId}","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-27T15:15:20.612279+08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-27T15:28:43.250798+08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-27T15:28:43.250798+08:00","source_repo":".","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"feishu_assistant-btv","depends_on_id":"feishu_assistant-0c7","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-11-27T15:15:20.613342+08:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

While this works for structured queries, it lacks the ability to:\n- Answer questions about historical OKR trends and patterns\n- Retrieve relevant context from past OKR reviews, meeting notes, or P\u0026L reports\n- Provide semantic search across OKR-related documents and conversations\n- Enable agents to learn from past OKR analysis patterns\n\n## Why This Matters\n\n**Project Goal Alignment**: This directly serves the core mission of building an intelligent Feishu AI assistant that can handle OKR review, P\u0026L analysis, and document tracking. RAG enables the assistant to be more contextually aware and provide better insights by learning from historical data.\n\n**Technical Benefits**:\n- **Better Context Retrieval**: Agents can find relevant past OKR reviews when answering new questions\n- **Semantic Understanding**: Users can ask \"What were the main issues last quarter?\" and get relevant historical context\n- **Knowledge Accumulation**: Past analyses become searchable knowledge that improves future responses\n- **Reduced Token Usage**: Only relevant historical context is retrieved, not entire conversation history\n\n**User Experience Benefits**:\n- More accurate answers by referencing past OKR reviews\n- Ability to track trends over time (\"How did Q3 compare to Q2?\")\n- Better recommendations based on historical patterns\n\n## Current State\n\n**What Exists**:\n- ✅ Document RAG infrastructure (`lib/rag/document-rag.ts`) - Can be used as template\n- ✅ pgvector migration (`005_enable_pgvector_and_document_embeddings.sql`) - Vector store ready\n- ✅ OKR data sources: DuckDB (`okr_metrics.db`), StarRocks (`okr_metrics` table)\n- ✅ OKR Reviewer Agent with analysis capabilities\n- ✅ OKR workflows (`okr-analysis-workflow.ts`) that query and analyze data\n\n**What's Missing**:\n- Vector embeddings for OKR data (metrics, reviews, analysis results)\n- Semantic search tool for OKR knowledge base\n- Integration of RAG into OKR Reviewer Agent\n- Workflow to populate embeddings from OKR data sources\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### Phase 1: Design OKR RAG Schema and Data Sources\n\n**What Needs to Be Done**:\n1. **Identify OKR Data Sources**:\n   - DuckDB `okr_metrics` table (structured metrics)\n   - StarRocks `okr_metrics` and `employee_fellow` tables\n   - Historical OKR analysis results (from past agent responses)\n   - Meeting notes or documents related to OKR reviews (if available)\n   - P\u0026L reports that reference OKR metrics (cross-domain knowledge)\n\n2. **Design Embedding Strategy**:\n   - **Structured Data**: Embed OKR metrics summaries (company, period, has_metric_percentage, key insights)\n   - **Analysis Results**: Embed past OKR analysis responses (agent-generated insights)\n   - **Metadata**: Include period, company, user_id for filtering\n   - **Chunking Strategy**: Determine optimal chunk size (likely 500-1000 tokens per chunk)\n\n3. **Define Vector Store Schema**:\n   - Table: `okr_embeddings` (similar to `document_embeddings`)\n   - Columns: `id`, `user_id`, `content`, `embedding vector(1536)`, `metadata JSONB`\n   - Metadata fields: `period`, `company`, `analysis_type`, `source` (duckdb/starrocks/analysis), `created_at`\n\n**Files to Create/Update**:\n- `supabase/migrations/006_create_okr_embeddings_table.sql` - New migration\n- `lib/rag/okr-rag.ts` - OKR-specific RAG implementation\n- `docs/design/okr-rag-architecture.md` - Design document (optional but recommended)\n\n**Success Criteria**:\n- ✅ Migration creates `okr_embeddings` table with RLS\n- ✅ Schema supports filtering by user_id, period, company\n- ✅ Metadata structure documented\n\n### Phase 2: Implement OKR Embedding Generation\n\n**What Needs to Be Done**:\n1. **Create Embedding Generation Function**:\n   - Query OKR metrics from DuckDB/StarRocks\n   - Format data into text chunks suitable for embedding\n   - Generate embeddings using OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (or configured embedder)\n   - Store embeddings in `okr_embeddings` table\n\n2. **Handle Different Data Sources**:\n   - **DuckDB**: Query `okr_metrics` table, format as \"Company X in Period Y: has_metric_percentage Z%, insights...\"\n   - **StarRocks**: Similar formatting for structured metrics\n   - **Analysis Results**: Embed past OKR analysis responses (if stored)\n   - **Incremental Updates**: Only embed new/changed data (track last_embedding_time)\n\n3. **User Scoping**:\n   - Respect RLS: Only embed data user has access to\n   - Use `getUserDataScope()` to filter by user permissions\n   - Store `user_id` for RLS enforcement\n\n**Files to Create**:\n- `lib/rag/okr-rag.ts` - Main OKR RAG implementation\n  - `generateOkrEmbeddings()` - Generate embeddings from OKR data\n  - `searchOkrKnowledge()` - Semantic search function\n  - `formatOkrDataForEmbedding()` - Convert structured data to text\n\n**Success Criteria**:\n- ✅ Can generate embeddings from DuckDB OKR metrics\n- ✅ Can generate embeddings from StarRocks OKR metrics\n- ✅ Embeddings stored with proper metadata and RLS\n- ✅ Incremental updates work (don't re-embed unchanged data)\n\n### Phase 3: Create OKR Semantic Search Tool\n\n**What Needs to Be Done**:\n1. **Create Vector Query Tool**:\n   - Use `createVectorQueryTool` from `@mastra/rag`\n   - Configure with PgVector store pointing to `okr_embeddings` table\n   - Set embedder to match embedding generation (text-embedding-3-small)\n\n2. **Implement Search Function**:\n   - Accept query string and optional filters (period, company, user_id)\n   - Perform vector similarity search\n   - Return top N results with scores and metadata\n   - Format results for agent consumption\n\n3. **Add Fallback**:\n   - If vector search fails or returns no results, fall back to keyword search\n   - Similar to document-rag.ts pattern\n\n**Files to Create**:\n- `lib/tools/okr-semantic-search-tool.ts` - Tool for agents to use\n- Update `lib/rag/okr-rag.ts` with search implementation\n\n**Success Criteria**:\n- ✅ Tool can be imported and used by agents\n- ✅ Returns relevant OKR context for queries\n- ✅ Respects user permissions (RLS)\n- ✅ Falls back gracefully if vector store unavailable\n\n### Phase 4: Integrate RAG into OKR Reviewer Agent\n\n**What Needs to Be Done**:\n1. **Add RAG Tool to OKR Agent**:\n   - Import `okrSemanticSearchTool` in `okr-reviewer-agent.ts`\n   - Add tool to agent's tools object\n   - Update agent instructions to mention RAG capability\n\n2. **Update Agent Instructions**:\n   - Explain when to use semantic search (historical questions, trend analysis)\n   - Guide agent to combine RAG results with fresh data queries\n   - Example: \"For questions about past quarters, use okrSemanticSearch to find relevant historical context\"\n\n3. **Test Integration**:\n   - Query: \"What were the main OKR issues last quarter?\"\n   - Verify agent uses RAG tool and combines with current data\n   - Verify response quality improves with historical context\n\n**Files to Update**:\n- `lib/agents/okr-reviewer-agent.ts` - Add RAG tool\n- `lib/agents/okr-reviewer-agent-mastra.ts` - Add RAG tool (if separate)\n\n**Success Criteria**:\n- ✅ OKR agent can use semantic search tool\n- ✅ Agent instructions guide proper RAG usage\n- ✅ Test queries show improved responses with historical context\n\n### Phase 5: Populate Initial Embeddings and Set Up Maintenance\n\n**What Needs to Be Done**:\n1. **Create Initial Population Script**:\n   - Script to generate embeddings for existing OKR data\n   - Can be run once to bootstrap the knowledge base\n   - Should handle large datasets (batch processing)\n\n2. **Set Up Incremental Updates**:\n   - Hook into OKR analysis workflow to generate embeddings for new analyses\n   - Or set up periodic job to sync new OKR metrics\n   - Track what's been embedded (avoid duplicates)\n\n3. **Documentation**:\n   - How to populate embeddings\n   - How to maintain/update embeddings\n   - How to query/use the RAG system\n\n**Files to Create**:\n- `scripts/populate-okr-embeddings.ts` - Initial population script\n- `docs/setup/okr-rag-setup.md` - Setup and maintenance guide\n\n**Success Criteria**:\n- ✅ Can populate embeddings from existing OKR data\n- ✅ Incremental updates work (new analyses get embedded)\n- ✅ Documentation complete\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n**Vector Store**:\n- Uses same Supabase PostgreSQL as document RAG\n- Reuses pgvector extension (already enabled)\n- Separate table (`okr_embeddings`) for OKR-specific data\n- RLS policies ensure user data isolation\n\n**Embedding Model**:\n- Default: `openai/text-embedding-3-small` (1536 dimensions)\n- Configurable via `OKR_RAG_EMBEDDER` env var\n- Cost: ~$0.02 per 1M tokens (very affordable for OKR data)\n\n**Performance**:\n- HNSW index for fast similarity search (\u003c10ms for typical queries)\n- Batch embedding generation for initial population\n- Incremental updates avoid re-processing unchanged data\n\n**Data Privacy**:\n- RLS ensures users only see their own OKR embeddings\n- User-scoped queries via `getUserDataScope()`\n- No cross-user data leakage\n\n## Dependencies\n\n**Blocks**:\n- None (can be done independently)\n\n**Blocked By**:\n- None (document RAG already provides template)\n\n**Related Work**:\n- Document RAG implementation (`lib/rag/document-rag.ts`) - Use as reference\n- OKR workflows (`lib/workflows/okr-analysis-workflow.ts`) - Can hook into for incremental updates\n- OKR Reviewer Agent - Will consume the RAG tool\n\n## Success Metrics\n\nAfter completion:\n- ✅ OKR agent can answer historical questions using RAG\n- ✅ Semantic search returns relevant past OKR analyses\n- ✅ Response quality improves for trend/pattern questions\n- ✅ Embeddings populated for existing OKR data\n- ✅ Incremental updates working (new analyses embedded automatically)\n\n## Risk Mitigation\n\n1. **Data Volume**: OKR data is relatively small, so embedding costs are minimal\n2. **RLS Safety**: Reuse proven RLS patterns from document RAG\n3. **Fallback**: Keyword search fallback if vector store unavailable\n4. **Testing**: Test with small dataset first, then scale up\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\n- Cross-domain RAG: Link OKR embeddings with P\u0026L and document embeddings\n- GraphRAG: Model relationships between OKRs, companies, periods\n- Auto-refresh: Periodic re-embedding as data changes\n- Multi-language: Support Chinese queries (embeddings work across languages)","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-08T18:19:48.307147+08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-08T18:19:48.307147+08:00","source_repo":"."}

The bot cannot retrieve and use previously stored user facts across conversations.\n\n## Current Status\n- ✅ Working memory functions implemented (`getWorkingMemory`, `updateWorkingMemory`)\n- ✅ Working memory extraction created (`working-memory-extractor.ts`)\n- ✅ Manager agent loads working memory\n- ✅ Working memory injected as system message\n- ❌ **Bot still cannot retrieve stored facts**\n\n## Test Scenario That Fails\n```bash\n1. User: \"@_user_2 My team size is 5 people\"\n2. Wait 2 minutes\n3. User: \"@_user_2 What's my team size?\"\nExpected: Bot responds \"5 people\"\nActual: Bot doesn't remember the team size\n```\n\n## Investigation Findings\n\n### 1. Memory Storage Implementation\n- **File**: `lib/memory-middleware.ts`\n- **Functions**: `getWorkingMemory()`, `updateWorkingMemory()`\n- **Storage Method**: Working memory stored as special system messages in thread\n- **Format**: JSON string in message content\n- **Issue**: Storage looks correct, retrieval may be broken\n\n### 2. Working Memory Extraction\n- **File**: `lib/working-memory-extractor.ts`\n- **Purpose**: Extract facts from agent responses (team size, goals, preferences)\n- **Patterns**: Regex-based extraction for common fact patterns\n- **Status**: Implemented but may not be triggering correctly\n\n### 3. Manager Agent Integration\n- **File**: `lib/agents/manager-agent-mastra.ts`\n- **Loading**: `getWorkingMemory(memoryContext)` called ✅\n- **Injection**: Added as system message to messages array ✅\n- **Context**: Working memory added to execution context ✅\n- **Issue**: Agent still doesn't use the stored facts\n\n### 4. Memory Backend\n- **System**: Mastra Memory with PostgreSQL (Supabase)\n- **Tables**: `mastra_threads`, `mastra_messages`, `mastra_resources`\n- **Configuration**: 3-layer architecture configured\n- **Status**: Basic memory operations work, working memory retrieval fails\n\n## Debugging Steps Taken\n\n### 1. Verified Implementation\n- ✅ All working memory functions exist\n- ✅ Manager agent calls working memory functions\n- ✅ System message injection implemented\n- ✅ Build compiles successfully\n\n### 2. Checked Logs\n- ❌ No \"Loaded working memory\" logs found\n- ❌ No \"Enhancing messages with working memory\" logs found\n- ❌ No \"Extracted team size\" logs found\n- **Conclusion**: Working memory loading may not be executing\n\n### 3. Checked DevTools\n- ✅ Agent calls tracked\n- ✅ Responses tracked\n- ❌ No working memory related events\n- **Conclusion**: Working memory code path not executed\n\n## Root Cause Hypotheses\n\n### Hypothesis 1: Memory Context Not Initialized\n- `initializeMemoryContext()` may be failing silently\n- `memoryContext` could be null/undefined\n- Working memory functions return early due to null context\n\n### Hypothesis 2: Thread/Resource ID Mismatch\n- Working memory stored with different thread/resource IDs\n- Retrieval uses different IDs than storage\n- Memory isolation broken between storage and retrieval\n\n### Hypothesis 3: Message Format Incompatibility\n- Working memory stored in wrong message format\n- `getWorkingMemory()` expects different message structure\n- JSON parsing fails silently\n\n### Hypothesis 4: Mastra Memory API Changes\n- Mastra Memory API may have changed\n- `query()` or `recall()` methods not working as expected\n- Working memory retrieval methods broken\n\n## Next Session Action Plan\n\n### Step 1: Add Debug Logging\nAdd extensive logging to working memory flow:\n```typescript\nconsole.log(`[Memory] Context initialized: ${!!memoryContext}`);\nconsole.log(`[Memory] Thread ID: ${memoryThread}`);\nconsole.log(`[Memory] Resource ID: ${memoryResource}`);\nconsole.log(`[Memory] Working memory loaded: ${!!workingMemory}`);\n```\n\n### Step 2: Verify Memory Storage\nCheck if working memory is actually being stored:\n```sql\n-- Check for system messages with JSON content\nSELECT * FROM mastra_messages \nWHERE role = 'system' AND content LIKE '{%}';\n```\n\n### Step 3: Test Memory Retrieval Directly\nCreate test script to verify working memory retrieval:\n```typescript\nconst memory = await createMastraMemory(userId);\nconst context = await initializeMemoryContext(userId, chatId, rootId);\nconst workingMemory = await getWorkingMemory(context);\nconsole.log('Working memory:', workingMemory);\n```\n\n### Step 4: Check Mastra Memory API\nVerify Mastra Memory API methods:\n- `memory.getThreadById()` works?\n- `memory.query()` returns messages?\n- `memory.recall()` returns messages?\n- Message format structure?\n\n### Step 5: Manual Memory Test\nBypass working memory functions and test direct storage/retrieval:\n```typescript\n// Store test data\nawait memory.saveMessages({\n  messages: [{\n    role: 'system',\n    content: JSON.stringify({teamSize: 5}),\n    threadId, resourceId\n  }]\n});\n\n// Retrieve test data\nconst result = await memory.query({threadId, resourceId});\nconsole.log('Retrieved messages:', result.messages);\n```\n\n## Files to Investigate\n\n1. **`lib/memory-middleware.ts`** - Core working memory functions\n2. **`lib/memory-mastra.ts`** - Mastra memory configuration\n3. **`lib/agents/manager-agent-mastra.ts`** - Working memory integration\n4. **`lib/working-memory-extractor.ts`** - Fact extraction logic\n5. **Supabase tables** - `mastra_threads`, `mastra_messages`, `mastra_resources`\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] Working memory is successfully stored in database\n- [ ] Working memory is successfully retrieved across conversations\n- [ ] Agent can access and use stored facts in responses\n- [ ] Test scenario passes: \"My team size is 5\" → \"What's my team size?\" → \"5 people\"\n\n## Priority: HIGH\nThis blocks the entire 3-layer memory system testing and is fundamental to the bot's usefulness.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-30T21:36:50.681776+08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-30T21:37:36.818815+08:00","source_repo":"."}

We need:\n- Visibility into what commands were run\n- What files were read\n- What SQL was executed\n- Timing and error information\n\nThis is CRITICAL for:\n- Debugging incorrect SQL\n- Understanding agent reasoning\n- Audit trail for compliance\n- Performance optimization\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Structured Logging\n\n```typescript\n// lib/tools/bash-exec-tool.ts\nimport { trace } from '../observability-config';\n\nexecute: async ({ context }) =\u003e {\n  const span = trace.startSpan('bash_exec');\n  span.setAttribute('command', command);\n  span.setAttribute('userId', userId);\n  \n  try {\n    const result = await sandbox.exec(command);\n    \n    span.setAttribute('exitCode', result.exitCode);\n    span.setAttribute('stdoutLength', result.stdout.length);\n    span.setStatus({ code: result.exitCode === 0 ? 'OK' : 'ERROR' });\n    \n    // Log to Langfuse/Phoenix\n    await logToolExecution({\n      tool: 'bash_exec',\n      input: { command, userId },\n      output: { exitCode: result.exitCode, truncated },\n      duration: span.duration,\n    });\n    \n    return result;\n  } finally {\n    span.end();\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Session Replay\n\nFor complex debugging, capture full session:\n\n```typescript\ninterface BashSession {\n  sessionId: string;\n  userId: string;\n  conversationId: string;\n  commands: Array\u003c{\n    command: string;\n    stdout: string;\n    stderr: string;\n    exitCode: number;\n    timestamp: Date;\n  }\u003e;\n  filesRead: string[];\n  filesWritten: string[];\n  sqlExecuted: Array\u003c{\n    sql: string;\n    rowCount: number;\n    error?: string;\n  }\u003e;\n}\n```\n\n### 3. AgentFS Audit Trail\n\nIf using AgentFS (not just-bash file map):\n- AgentFS has built-in toolcall logging\n- Can query file operation history\n- Enables replay of problematic sessions\n\n### 4. Integration with Existing Observability\n\n- Langfuse: Tool call tracing\n- Phoenix (Arize): If configured\n- Supabase: Store session logs for analysis\n\n## Logging Levels\n\n| Level | What | When |\n|-------|------|------|\n| DEBUG | Full stdout/stderr | Dev only |\n| INFO | Command, exitCode, timing | Always |\n| WARN | Truncation, slow queries | Always |\n| ERROR | Failures, SQL errors | Always |\n\n## Dashboard/Queries\n\nEnable queries like:\n- 'Show all SQL executed by user X today'\n- 'Find sessions with failed SQL'\n- 'Average time for OKR queries'\n- 'Most common bash commands'\n\n## Files to Modify\n- lib/tools/bash-exec-tool.ts\n- lib/tools/execute-sql-tool.ts\n- lib/observability-config.ts\n\n## Files to Create\n- lib/infra/tool-logger.ts\n\n## Time Estimate: 3-4 hours","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-29T19:17:22.338681+08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-29T19:17:22.338681+08:00","source_repo":".","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"feishu_assistant-nocy","depends_on_id":"feishu_assistant-4ib3","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-29T19:17:22.34041+08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"feishu_assistant-nocy","depends_on_id":"feishu_assistant-zwah","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-29T19:17:22.341698+08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"feishu_assistant-nocy","depends_on_id":"feishu_assistant-lvna","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-12-29T19:17:22.342528+08:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Existing queries we can validate against\n\n## Current State (pnl-agent-mastra.ts)\n- Uses specialized tools for P\u0026L queries\n- Heavy prompt engineering for each tool\n- Implicit knowledge of schema in tool descriptions\n\n## Target State\n- Two tools only: bash_exec, execute_sql\n- Agent learns schema by exploring /semantic-layer/\n- Agent writes SQL based on metric definitions\n- More flexible, less maintenance\n\n## Implementation\n\n### New Agent Definition\n\n```typescript\n// lib/agents/pnl-agent-mastra.ts (refactored)\nimport { Agent } from '@mastra/core';\nimport { bashExecTool } from '../tools/bash-exec-tool';\nimport { executeSqlTool } from '../tools/execute-sql-tool';\n\nexport const pnlAgent = new Agent({\n  name: 'pnl_analyst',\n  model: openrouter('anthropic/claude-sonnet'),\n  matchOn: ['pnl', 'profit', 'loss', '损益', '利润', '亏损', 'revenue', 'margin', 'ebitda'],\n  \n  instructions: `You are a P\u0026L (Profit \u0026 Loss) analyst for the Feishu assistant.\n\n## Your Workflow\n\n1. **EXPLORE FIRST**: Before writing any SQL, use bash to understand the data model:\n   \\`\\`\\`bash\n   ls /semantic-layer/metrics/          # See available metrics\n   ls /semantic-layer/entities/         # See available tables\n   grep -r \"revenue\" /semantic-layer/  # Find revenue-related definitions\n   cat /semantic-layer/metrics/revenue.yaml  # Read specific metric\n   \\`\\`\\`\n\n2. **CHECK EXAMPLES**: Look at example queries for guidance:\n   \\`\\`\\`bash\n   ls /pnl/examples/\n   cat /pnl/examples/quarterly_comparison.sql\n   \\`\\`\\`\n\n3. **UNDERSTAND TERMS**: Check the glossary for business definitions:\n   \\`\\`\\`bash\n   cat /docs/glossary/financial_terms.md\n   \\`\\`\\`\n\n4. **WRITE SQL**: Based on your exploration, write SQL:\n   \\`\\`\\`bash\n   cat \u003e /workspace/query.sql \u003c\u003c 'EOF'\n   SELECT ...\n   FROM ...\n   WHERE ...\n   EOF\n   \\`\\`\\`\n\n5. **EXECUTE**: Run the query:\n   - Use execute_sql with your SQL\n   - Request markdown format for readable output\n\n6. **EXPLAIN**: Interpret results for the user in business terms\n\n## Key Principles\n- NEVER guess at column names - always verify via cat on entity files\n- ALWAYS check metric definitions for correct calculations\n- Include helpful context when presenting results\n- Use Chinese when responding to Chinese queries\n\n## Available Directories\n- /semantic-layer/metrics/ - Metric definitions with SQL expressions\n- /semantic-layer/entities/ - Table schemas with column descriptions\n- /pnl/examples/ - Example SQL queries\n- /docs/glossary/ - Business term definitions\n- /workspace/ - Your scratch space\n`,\n  \n  tools: {\n    bash_exec: bashExecTool,\n    execute_sql: executeSqlTool,\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### Key Prompt Changes\n\n**Before**: Tool descriptions contained schema knowledge\n**After**: Agent discovers schema via bash exploration\n\nThis shift means:\n- Less prompt maintenance when schema changes\n- Agent can handle novel queries by exploring\n- More transparency (we can see what files it read)\n\n## Validation Approach\n\nTest against known P\u0026L queries from production:\n\n| Query Type | Expected Behavior |\n|------------|-------------------|\n| 'Q4 revenue by BU' | Explores metrics, finds revenue.yaml, writes correct SQL |\n| 'Compare GP margin Q3 vs Q4' | Finds gross_profit.yaml, uses correct calculation |\n| 'Which BU has highest margin?' | Aggregates correctly, handles NULL |\n| '本季度利润分析' (Chinese) | Same workflow, responds in Chinese |\n\n## Rollback Plan\n- Keep old pnl-agent-mastra.ts as pnl-agent-mastra.ts.backup\n- Feature flag: USE_BASH_SQL_AGENTS env var\n- Can revert by toggling flag\n\n## Files to Modify\n- lib/agents/pnl-agent-mastra.ts (refactor)\n- lib/agents/pnl-agent-mastra.ts.backup (copy current)\n\n## Files to Create\n- test/agents/pnl-agent-bash-sql.test.ts\n\n## Time Estimate: 4-6 hours (including testing)","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-29T19:14:59.945509+08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-29T19:14:59.945509+08:00","source_repo":".","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"feishu_assistant-yx8m","depends_on_id":"feishu_assistant-4ib3","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-29T19:14:59.948041+08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"feishu_assistant-yx8m","depends_on_id":"feishu_assistant-zwah","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-29T19:14:59.949309+08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"feishu_assistant-yx8m","depends_on_id":"feishu_assistant-lvna","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-12-29T19:14:59.950131+08:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}
